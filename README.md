# The Complete JavaScript Course 2021
Repo to upload the lessons from "[The Complete JavaScript Course 2021: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course)" by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://codingheroes.io/)  on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).

## Original
You can check the original repo by the teacher on [this link](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/complete-javascript-course). The repo does not use the "starter / final" folders, instead all the lessons remain under the root folder of that section and annotations are in the markdown format.
