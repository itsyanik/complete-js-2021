# Some

The some method returns true if any of the elements in the array satisfies the condition that is given to it. `arr.some((el, index, arr) => condition)`

# Every

In the other hand, the `every` method will only return true if ALL elements satisfy the given condition. `arr.every((el, index, arr) => condition)`.
