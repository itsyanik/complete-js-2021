# DOM

What is the DOM? It's short for Document Object Model. It's the structured representation of HTML documents. It allows JS to access it's elements to change style and manipulate them.

The DOM elements are structured in a tree-like structure, and we use words like parent, child, sibling and node to refer to the elements. The entry point to the DOM Tree is the Document, as it always shows up in HTML structures and we need it in order to access any of the other elements.

PSA: DOM is NOT part of the JS language. DOM methods and APIs are part of the WEB APIs and they can interact with our code.

PSA2: API = Aplication Programing Interface

# DOM Manipulation

DOM Manipulation is how we call the technique of manipulating DOM elements using JavaScript.
