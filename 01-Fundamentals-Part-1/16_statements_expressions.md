# Statements vs. Expressions
This is just a high level overview!!

An expression is a piece of code that produces a value (*eg*: `3 + 4`). It doesn't have to necessarily be an entire line of code.
An statement is a bigger piece of code that is executed and does not produce any value on it's own.

Making an analogy to the spoke language, the declaration is the complete sentence and the expressions are like the words that make up the sentence.
