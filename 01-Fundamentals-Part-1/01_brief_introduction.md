# What is JavaScript?
There are many ways to define what JavaScript is, but for this course we'll define it as high-level, object oriented, multi paradigm programming language. But what does any of that mean?

## Programing language
A programming language is a tool that allows us to write code that instructs the computer to do something.

## High Level
A high level programming language is one that allows us to write our code without having to worry about more complex stuff such as memory management while it runs the program. This is because the language itself will do all of that for us. These are called abstractions in JavaScript and it makes the language a lot more easier to write and learn.

## Object Oriented
This means that the language is mostly based on the concept of objects for storing all kinds of data.

## Multi Paradigm
A multi paradigm programming language is one that is very flexible and versatile that it allows us to use many types of programming styles such as imperative and declarative programming. They're just ways of organizing our code.

# Web Development
With all the definitions out of the way we can start thinking about JavaScript's role in web development. Lets take a loot at the web's core technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These three technologies work together to create beautiful, dynamic and interactive websites or web applications.

## HTML
Is the one responsible for the contents of the page such as buttons, paragraphs and images.

```javascript
const html = {
  responsability: "Page contents",
  examples: ["buttons", "paragraphs", "images"]
};
```

## CSS
Is the one responsible for the presentation of the page with styling and basically laying out the presentation of the web page.

```javascript
const css = {
  responsability: "Page presentation",
  examples: ["colors", "styling", "layouting the page"]
};
```

## JavaScript
Is the programming language of the internet (alongside PHP) that allows us to build dynamic, interactive effects of any webpage. It's also used to manipulate contents of the page or the css, load data from a server and building entire applications in the browser, which we call web applications.

```javascript
const js = {
  responsability: "Page interactivity",
  examples: ["manipulate content", "manipulate style", "load data from server", "build web apps"]
};
```

## Analogy
With that in mind we can then make an analogy about the technologies, where the HTML are the nouns (*eg*. saying that the element is a **paragraph**), CSS are the adjectives (*eg*. saying that the *paragraph element* **is blue**) and JavaScript are the verbs (*eg*. saying that the *paragraph* should be **hidden**) of a web page.
