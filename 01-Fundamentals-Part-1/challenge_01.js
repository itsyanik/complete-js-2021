/* Coding Challenge#1

    Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), 
    which is calculated using the formula:
    BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height)(mass in kg and height in meter).
    Your tasks:
    1.Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
    2.Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions)
    3.Create a Booleanvariable 'markHigherBMI'containing information about whether
     Mark has a higher BMI than John.
     
     Test data:
     Data1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
     Data2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.
     
     GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
