/* 
  Let's go back to Mark and John comparing their BMIs! 
  
  This time, let's use objects to implement the calculations! 
  
  Remember: BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height)
  (mass in kg and height in meter)
  
  Your tasks:
  1.For each of them, create an object with properties for their 
  full name (Mark Miller and John Smith), 
  mass, and 
  height 
  
  2.Create a 'calcBMI'method on each object to calculate the BMI 
  (the same method on both objects). 
  Store the BMI value to a property, and also return it from the method
  
  3.Log to the console who has the higher BMI, together with the 
  full name and the respective BMI. 
  
  Example: "John's BMI (28.3) is higher than Mark's (23.9)!"
  
  Test data:
  Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69m tall. 
  John weights 92 kg and is 1.95m tall.
  
  GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
